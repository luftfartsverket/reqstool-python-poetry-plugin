== Usage

=== Decorators

Used to decorate your code as seen in the examples below, the decorator processing that runs during the build process collects data from the decorated code.

Import decorators:

```
from reqstool_python_decorators.decorators.decorators import Requirements, SVCs
```

Example usage of the decorators:

```
@Requirements("REQ_111", "REQ_222")
def somefunction():
```

```
@SVCs("SVC_111", "SVC_222")
def test_somefunction():
```

=== Poetry Build

When running `$poetry build` or `$poetry install` the plugin will run the `activate` function located inside `ReqstoolPlugin` class, calling functions from the `reqstool-python-decorators` package and generate a annotations.yml file in the `build/reqstool/` folder containing formatted data on all decorated code found.

Additionaly it will generate a `reqstool_config.yml` in the root of the project.
